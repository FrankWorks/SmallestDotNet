SmallestDotNet
==============

SmallestDotNet - [SmallestDotNet.com](http://smallestdotnet.com) is a single page site that does one thing. It tells you the smallest, easiest download you'd need to get the .NET Framework on your system. 

The code sucks. I did it in an hour and I'm sad.

Thanks to Calin Balauru for his help. Anything good here is him. All the bad is me.
